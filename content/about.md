# What is this?
My goal is to launch projects with technical and/or artistic dimensions that either:
1. add a bit of joy or whimsy to make the city a more fun place to live, or
2. provide something functional the city is currently missing.

# Why the name?
Ottawa city council [decided](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa-s-new-slogan-technically-beautiful-1.266126) to give itself the slogan 'Ottawa: technically beautiful' in 2001 with the idea that it would represent Ottawa's natural beauty and tech prowess. Most of the people I know thought the slogan was hilarious. Given that the goal is to launch projects based in the National Capital Region with both technical and artistic dimensions, I thought the name would be fun and might bring a laugh.
