![Gatineau Shelter Pins](/images/pins.jpg)
I grew up skiing in the Gatineaus and have always loved the day shelters. I'm hoping these pins will add some extra charm to them — and maybe encourage people to visit shelters they’ve never made it out to before. They’re meant to be simple, collectable, and just a little whimsical.
