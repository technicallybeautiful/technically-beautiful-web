![Gatineau Shelter Pins](/images/pins.jpg)
I grew up skiing in the Gatineaus and have always loved the day shelters. I'm hoping these pins will add some extra charm to them — and maybe encourage people to visit shelters they’ve never made it out to before. They’re meant to be simple, collectable, and just a little whimsical.
## Status
Pins have now been dropped off at:
- Keogan, Shilly Shally, Huron, and Western.
- Healey and Herridge
- Brown

I will update here as more are dropped off.
