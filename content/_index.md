title = 'Technically Beautiful Ottawa'

# Why the name?
Ottawa city council [decided](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa-s-new-slogan-technically-beautiful-1.266126) to give itself the slogan 'Ottawa: technically beautiful' in 2001 with the idea that it would represent Ottawa's natural beauty and tech prowess. Most of the people I know thought the slogan was hilarious. Given that the goal is to launch projects based in the National Capital Region with a mix of technical and artistic aspects, I thought the name would be fun and might bring a laugh.

# What is this?
My goal is to launch some projects with a mixture of technical and artisitc aspects and which help (1) make the city a more fun place to live now by adding some joy or whimsy or  (2) add something functional which seems to be missing from the city.
